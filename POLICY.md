# Policy

This document will lay out the official policies used within Pulsar-Edit. This document lists the various policies that have come about naturally as the project progressed and so deserve to be properly documented and viewable by anyone.

## Polls

A cornerstone of the way the Pulsar team interacts with the community is via Polls. These polls are usually created on Discord, but may in the future be expanded to other platforms as needed.

A Poll is used to allow the community at large to easily and quickly contribute to a conversation and provide their opinions on future development or goals of Pulsar-Edit.

* Whenever we need to make a decision that will affect a large percentage of users/contributors, make a substantial enough change, drastically affect a small percentage of users/contributors then a poll must be made.
* A Poll must be available for voting for at least 24 hours to accommodate different timezones and work schedules. Polls may be longer than this, but must never be shorter.
* If a poll fails, then you must not recreate the exact same poll right afterwards. If the same idea has new merit or new validation at a later time, communicate with the community to determine if another poll is reasonable.

## Repeat Questions

Many times Pulsar throughout our various social platforms will receive repeated suggestions, and sometimes these suggestions are untenable for whatever reasons. In these cases if we find ourselves repeatedly using the same answer, a discussion will happen at the Pulsar Admin Team level on whether or not to add this conversation to our official [FAQ](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/.github/blob/main/FAQ.md) at which point, if agreed, a PR will be made and the community will be able to discuss it being added. The wording in that PR, if merged, then becomes the official stance on the topic and will be used in any further discussions.

## Pull Request Merging

Obviously Pull Requests are an important part to software development.

We get a lot of them, and there's not always enough of us to review everything in a timely manner. But below are some general guidelines.

* Prior to merging there should be a best effort to allow two approvals of a PR.
* A Pull Request should not be merged right away unless there is aduquate reason to do so. (e.g. This PR fixes a serious bug in the application, and is of a rather small change. This PR fixes a security issue.)

## Donations

We accept and encourage all donations to the project. These donations help Pulsar be great, and to achieve our goals.

A donation to Pulsar-Edit will always be used for the greater good of the editor and its ecosystem. However, donators must understand that the use of funds will be left to the discretion of the Pulsar team.

Any money donated can and will be used used for Pulsar-Edit. A donation, unless as part of a reward for donating or other specifically indicated event, does not allow a donator any extra say in how the Pulsar team will operate. A donation does not allow directed use of the funds, nor does it allow control of the funds after they have been donated.

Quickly put:

When you donate to Pulsar, we are __not__ promising to spend money on anything in particular, nor will we necessarily be spending funds on anything other than our basic operating costs. Ultimately, the Pulsar team reserves discretion to use the funds in the best interests of Pulsar-Edit, and any decisions are ultimately done by the team in their capacity as folks with the responsibility over the project.

We thank you for any understanding, and we sincerely appreciate and express gratitude to anyone who donates.
