# Policy

This document will lay out the official policies used within the Pulsar Edit Project. Documenting the policies that have come out of our normal usage, that deserve to be properly documented and viewable by anyone.

## Polls

A cornerstone of the way Pulsar interacts with the community is via Polls. These polls are usually created on Discord, but may in the future be expanded to other platforms as needed.

A Poll is used to allow the community at large to easily and quickly contribute to a conversation and provide thier opinions on future development or goals of the Pulsar Project.

* Whenever a decision will effect a large percentage of users/contributors, a change is substantal enough, or will drastically effect a small percentage of users/contributors then a poll must be made.
* A Poll must be available for voting for at least 24 hours, to accommodate different timezones, and work schedules. Polls can be longer than this, but must never be shorter.
* If a poll fails, then you must not recreate the exact same poll right afterwards. If the same idea has new merit or new validation at a later time, communicate with the community to determine if another poll is reasonable.

## Repeat Questions

Many times Pulsar throughout our various social platforms will receive repeated suggestions, and sometimes these suggestions are untenable for whatever various reasons. In these cases if we find ourselves repeatedly using the same answer, a discussion will happen at the Pulsar Admin Team level, on whether or not to add this conversation to our official [FAQ](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/.github/blob/main/FAQ.md) at which point, if agreed a PR will be made, and the community at large will be able to discuss it being added. At which point if it's added that now becomes the official stance and will be used in further discussion on the topic.

## Pull Request Merging

Obviously Pull Requests are an important part to software development.

We get a lot of them, and there's not always enough of us to review everything in a timely manner. But below are some general guidelines.

* Prior to merging there should be a best effort to allow two approvals of a PR.
* A Pull Request should not be merged right away unless there is aduquate reason to do so. (e.g. This PR fixes a serious bug in the application, and is of a rather small change. This PR fixes a security issue.)

## Donations

We accept and encourage contributors to donate to the platform when they fiscally can. As these donations help Pulsar be great, and do what it needs to do.

A donation through Pulsar will always be used for the greater good of the editor and it's ecosystem at large. But donators must understand that the use of funds will be dependent on the discretion of Pulsars Core Maintainers.

But officially when you donate this money is now used for the Pulsar project. A donation, unless as part of a gift for donating or other specifically indicated event, does not allow a donator any extra say in how Pulsar will operate. A donation does not allow directed use of the funds, and does not allow control of the funds after they have been donated.

Quickly put:

When you donate to Pulsar, we are __not__ promising to spend money on anything in particular, nor will we necessarily be spending funds on anything other than our basic operating costs. Ultimately, maintianers maintain discretion to use the funds in the best interests of the Pulsar Project, and any decisions are ultimately done by maintianers in their capacity as folks with the responsibility over the project.

We thank you for any understanding, and sincerely appreciate, and express gratitude to anyone who donates.
