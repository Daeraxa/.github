# Welcome to Pulsar

Pulsar, or sometimes referred to as Pulsar-Edit is a new image of the beloved 'Hackable Text Editor' [Atom](https://github.com/atom/atom).

After the announcement of [Atom's sunset](https://github.blog/2022-06-08-sunsetting-atom/), the community came together to keep Atom alive via the longstanding fork [Atom-Community](https://github.com/atom-community/atom).

Although due to the difference in goals for the editor long term a new version was born Pulsar.

Pulsar aims to not only reach feature parity with the original Atom, but to bring Pulsar into the 21st century, updating the underlying architecture and supporting modern features.

With many new features intended to come once things are stable Pulsar will be a true Community-Based Hackable Text Editor.
