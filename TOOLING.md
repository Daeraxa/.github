# Pulsar tooling

Here you will find a list of tools used by the Pulsar team and information about them.

## Continuous Integration

[Cirrus CI](https://cirrus-ci.com/github/pulsar-edit/pulsar) is used for Pulsar's continuous integration as well as for building application binaries.

## i18n (Internationalization)

[Crowdin](https://crowdin.pulsar-edit.dev/) will be used for Pulsar's internationalization efforts but exact details on this are still pending.

## Additional Testing tools

[Action: Pulsar Dependency](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/action-pulsar-dependency) is a GitHub action used to test changes of a core Pulsar Dependency
if you need to determine how your core package dependency will run on the current version of the Pulsar Editor.
