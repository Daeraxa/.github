The Github integration is a bit grating, because I'm such a Freedom maximalist and refusitarian or closed jank. Perhaps an option for a fully-Free git host integration as the first option, like sr.ht or whatever, instead of github being first on the list?"

Therefore, I would suggest to loosen the ties between Pulsar and GitHub, and to start self-hosting the code independently from GitHub (at least parallel to GitHub) like with the use of cgit (https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/). I think this would provide a more decentralized and therefore more solid basis for this great project of Pulsar, to be able to resist such difficulties like the one with over-prioritization of VSCode which eventually resulted in completely shutting down Atom.
