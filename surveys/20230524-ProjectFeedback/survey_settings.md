# Project feedback

<!--Section 1-->

We want to reach out to our wonderful community again and this time we are after opinions on some changes we want to make within Pulsar itself.

Some of these changes may elicit strong opinions from people so we felt it only right to seek the opinion of the wider community so we can try to make the correct decision.

We have a few questions on the next few pages asking for feedback on updates to our iconography, feedback for our documentation and a needing GitHub to publish community packages.

We do not record any personal information at all in this survey, all responses are anonymous. Any personal information accidentally provided in a response will be deleted before making the results of this survey public.

## Iconography Update

<!--Section 2-->

Pulsar is using an icon set called [Octicons](https://primer.style/design/foundations/icons/) for its Iconography however the version being used is old (v4.4.0 - from 2016!) and there have been many, many updates since then with a whole bunch of new icons and improvements (now on version v18.3.0).

This new version has a bunch of new items that can be used in Pulsar itself as well as being made available for new packages and themes so we have an opportunity to modernize the UI. We would still plan to leave v4.4.0 as accessible to anyone who wants to use it.

We have a [PR open](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/pull/509) to update to this new version of Octicons but you will notice there are some quite large differences between the old and the new. To see some potential directions this could be taken in, have a look at the following images. First we have the current icon set and then we have two possible variations on the updated set.

We would like to hear your opinions on the matter so please vote on what style you prefer and leave any comments you have. (This is **not** final, this is just to see what direction we should be going in).

## Documentation Site Update

<!--Section 3-->

We have plans to overhaul our documentation (both the site/framework and the structure of the documentation). For this we are just after some general feedback on what people like or dislike about the current docs and how it compares to other project documentation you like.

It can be anything from the layout to the structure or to the wording. We have an opportunity to really make some improvements and we want to make sure we provide what people actually want.

The current site can be found [on our website](https://pulsar-edit.dev/docs/).

## Opinion on GitHub requirement for community packages

<!--Section 4-->

 Currently, in order to publish a package to the Pulsar package registry it is a requirement to make your package available in a GitHub repository. We would like to know if this is something that is stopping any of our community from publishing packages.

### Are you interested in developing community packages for Pulsar

- Multiple choice
- Not required

- Yes
- No

### If so, what are your thoughts on the GitHub requirement?

- Multiple choice
- Not required

- I have no opinion on what platform is used to publish community packages
- I would prefer not to use GitHub to publish packages but it would not prevent me
- I will not publish a package if GitHub is the only option
