After the sunset of Atom we decided that we couldn't let it die, Pulsar is the modernized new version of what Atom was.

We aim to modernize and enhance the experience of the editor while keeping it's vibrant and huge ecosystem and community alive. Allowing the editor to enter the next century better than it was left all while having an important focus on being Community-Led and Transparent.

We are happy you are here, and hope you stay gazing at the stars with us.
